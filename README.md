This Project focuses on programming and testing four optimization methods for unconstrained problems: Steepest Descent (SD), Newton’s Method (NM), Linear Conjugate Gradient (linCG), and Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient (nonlinCG). These methods are evaluated on three problem categories: (i) ill conditioned quadratic problems using the Hilbert matrix, (ii) linear least-squares problems (such as polynomial fitting), and (iii) nonlinear least-squares problems involving sums of Gaussians. The testing is conducted over 30 tasks, with the SD and linCG methods applied to category (i), linCG to category (ii), and all methods except linCG to category (iii).
